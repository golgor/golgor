# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Robert currently working with electrical engineering. I have always been interested in coding, but it is something I previously haven't had enough time doing. As I'm always keen on learning new things I'm currently looking into improving my Python skills. Also interested in Golang.

I love technology in any shape and always try to understand how and why they work. Anything from molecular reactions to engineering or the human psyche.
